# Silent-Help-Application
Silent Help is a voice-activated SOS app for emergencies. Unlike traditional safety apps that require touch, it lets users discreetly ask for help using voice commands, sending instant alerts and live location to trusted contacts. This ensures quick, silent assistance in dangerous situations without alerting attackers.
